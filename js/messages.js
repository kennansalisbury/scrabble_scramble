let playerPlay = `
    <h4>Player ${currentPlayer}, you're up!</h4>
    <p>Drag & drop tiles onto the board to create a word.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Click “Recall” if at any point before playing a word you want to bring all of your current play tiles back to your tile board.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Once you are happy with your word, click “Play” to play your word.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Or, if you can’t come up with a word - click “Pass.” This will give up your turn and we’ll see if Player 2 can come up with a word.</p>
